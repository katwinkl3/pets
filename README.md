2. Change the password of the postgres database to your password in server.js.
3. Navigate to the backend folder
4. Run `npm install`
5. Run `nodemon server.js` to keep the server running. 

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the frontend folder
2. Run `npm install`

Voila, you should see the frontend running in your web browser. Try to click on Signup and submit the form. Then check on your database- you should see that the new user has been added.
